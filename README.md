# Symbolic TopHat

This repo contains a symbolic execution engine for [TopHat](https://github.com/timjs/tophat),
a formalisation of Task-Oriented Programming.
The code here is a deep embedding of the entire TopHat language,
including the underlying lambda calculus,
on which TopHat is built.
For an embedding with Haskell as host language,
take a look at the [TopHat Haskell](https://github.com/timjs/tophat-haskell) implementation.

## Paper

The paper behind all this code is published at IFL'19

## Building

Clone the repository and build it by running Cabal's new commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/timjs/tophat-haskell.git
cd tophat-haskell
cabal new-build
cabal new-run
```

You'll need GHC-8.6 or newer.
